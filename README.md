# SQL-and-Python-Advanced-Sales-Analysis

As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with providing insights for the product team using four datasets. These datasets were provided to help the product team identify trends and patterns to guide their project strategy. Below, Iâ€™ll outline the steps I took to complete the tasks, as well as the SQL and Python techniques used to analyze the data.

Step 1: Data Preparation
I started by loading the four datasets into a database from the Salla platform. Salla is an e-commerce platform that allows merchants to create an online store or expand their business online.
I used (Microsoft SQL Server) for this case, as it is a robust database system for handling large datasets and complex queries. After importing the data, I explored the dataset schema to understand the relationships between the tables. This step was crucial as it enabled me to effectively join the tables later in SQL.

Step 2: SQL Tasks
I completed the first four tasks using SQL to extract insights from the data.

Step 3: Python Tasks
For the next three tasks, I used Python along with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualization.
